          <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. ... Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. </p>

          <p>In academic writing, most paragraphs include at least three sentences, though rarely more than ten.</p>
